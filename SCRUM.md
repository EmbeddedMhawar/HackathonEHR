# Applying Agile Scrum to the EHR Project

This document outlines how to apply the Agile Scrum framework to this project.

## 1. Introduction to Scrum

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints.

## 2. Scrum Roles

*   **Product Owner:** This person is responsible for managing the Product Backlog. They represent the stakeholders and are the voice of the customer. They are responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. In this project, the Product Owner would be responsible for writing and prioritizing the user stories in the `.feature` files.
*   **Scrum Master:** This person is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values. The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.
*   **Development Team:** The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. The Development Team in this project are the developers writing the TypeScript code.

## 3. Scrum Artifacts

*   **Product Backlog:** The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The existing `.feature` files are a great starting point for the Product Backlog. Each `Scenario` can be considered a Product Backlog Item (PBI) or a user story.
*   **Sprint Backlog:** The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.
*   **Increment:** The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done," which means it must be in a usable condition and meet the Scrum Teamâ€™s definition of "Done".

## 4. Scrum Events

*   **Sprint Planning:** At the beginning of each sprint, the Scrum Team holds a Sprint Planning meeting to decide what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint.
*   **Daily Scrum:** The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
*   **Sprint Review:** At the end of the Sprint, a Sprint Review is held to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
*   **Sprint Retrospective:** The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

## 5. Applying Scrum to this Project

### Product Backlog Management

The existing `.feature` files provide a solid foundation for your Product Backlog. Here's how you can build upon them:

1.  **Refine User Stories:** Review the `Scenario` sections in your `.feature` files. Ensure they are clear, concise, and follow the INVEST (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) criteria.
2.  **Prioritize the Backlog:** The Product Owner should order the user stories in the backlog based on their value, risk, and dependencies. For example, `1UserRegistration.feature` might be a higher priority than `0MedicalRecordHash.feature`.
3.  **Break Down User Stories:** Break down larger user stories into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, the "Registering a new doctor" scenario can be broken down into:
    *   Create the UI for the registration form.
    *   Implement the `signUpPatient` function.
    *   Write unit tests for the `authService`.
    *   Create the Hedera account for the new user.
4.  **Estimate User Stories:** Use a technique like story points to estimate the effort required to complete each user story.

### Sprint Planning and Execution

*   **Sprint Length:** A typical sprint length is 2 weeks.
*   **Sprint Goal:** For each sprint, define a clear Sprint Goal. For example, "Implement the complete user registration and login functionality."
*   **Task Board:** Use a physical or digital task board (like Jira, Trello, or GitHub Projects) to visualize the Sprint Backlog. Create columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

### Definition of "Done"

Create a clear "Definition of Done" that the team agrees upon. This ensures that everyone has a shared understanding of what it means for a task to be complete. A good Definition of Done for this project could be:

*   Code is written and peer-reviewed.
*   Unit tests are written and passing.
*   The feature is manually tested and works as expected.
*   The code is merged into the main branch.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively implement Scrum in your EHR project and improve your team's productivity and the quality of your product.
