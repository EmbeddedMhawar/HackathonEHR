});

When(/^"([^"]*)" presents his personal QR code from the EHR mobile app$/, function (userName: string) {
  // Implementation pending: Set the QR code payload (patient's account ID) in the test's context.
});

When(/^Dr. Smith scans the QR code using the platform's doctor portal$/, function () {

When(/^the system prompts "([^"]*)" on his app to grant access to Dr. Smith$/, function (userName: string) {
