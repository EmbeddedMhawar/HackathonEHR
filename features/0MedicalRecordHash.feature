Feature: Medical Record Hash Submission and Verification on Hedera
  As a healthcare provider
  I want to submit and verify medical record hashes on the Hedera network
  So that I can prove the existence and integrity of medical records without exposing sensitive data

  Background:
    Given the EHR platform is connected to the Hedera network

    # TODO: Implement the scenario for creating a hash from a medical record.
  # Example:
  # Scenario: Creating a hash from a medical record
  #   Given a medical record for patient "patient-123" with the following details:
  #     | field       | value                   |
  #     | diagnosis   | "Hypertension"          |
  #     | treatment   | "Lisinopril 10mg daily" |
  #     | date        | "2023-10-27"            |
  #   When the system serializes the medical record to a JSON string
  #   And computes the SHA-256 hash of the JSON string
  #   Then the resulting hash is stored for submission

  Scenario: Submitting a medical record hash to Hedera
    Given a medical record is hashed using a cryptographic hash function
    When the hash is submitted to the Hedera Consensus Service topic
    Then the transaction receipt should confirm the message was successfully submitted

  Scenario: Verifying the existence of a medical record hash on Hedera
    Given a hash of a medical record
    When the system queries the Hedera Mirror Node for the hash in the specified topic
    Then the system should confirm the hash exists, proving the record's authenticity
