Feature: Medical Record Hash Submission and Verification on Hedera
  As a healthcare provider
  I want to submit and verify medical record hashes on the Hedera network
  So that I can prove the existence and integrity of medical records without exposing sensitive data

  Background:
    Given the EHR platform is connected to the Hedera network

  # TODO: Implement the scenario for creating a hash from a medical record.
  
  # Example:
  #Scenario: Creating a hash from a medical record document
  #  Given a medical record document in a specific format (e.g., PDF, DICOM, HL7)
  #  And the medical record contains the following details:
  #   | field       | value                   |
  #   | diagnosis   | "Hypertension"          |
  #   | treatment   | "Lisinopril 10mg daily" |
  #   | date        | "2023-10-27"            |
  #  When the system serializes the medical record to a JSON string
  #  When the system extracts and standardizes the medical record data into a canonical JSON format
  #  And computes the SHA-256 hash of the JSON string
  #  Then the resulting hash is stored for submission

  Scenario: Submitting a medical record hash to Hedera
    Given a medical record is hashed using a cryptographic hash function
    When the hash is submitted to the Hedera Consensus Service topic
    Then the transaction receipt should confirm the message was successfully submitted

  Scenario: Verifying the existence of a medical record hash on Hedera
    Given a hash of a medical record
    When the system queries the Hedera Mirror Node for the hash in the specified topic
    Then the system should confirm the hash exists, proving the record's authenticity
